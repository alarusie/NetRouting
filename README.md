# NetRouting
A network simulation tool to demonstrate a network routing problem. First, it generates a set of number of randomly connected computer network components (nodes, routers, and wires). Then, it simulates packet transmission between network nodes while using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find the shortest path between a sender and receiver.
