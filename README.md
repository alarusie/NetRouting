# NetRouting
This is a class project that i proposed for C S 504. Computer Networks I. The code generates a set of number of nodes and routers, and randomly connect those nodes together while generating routing tables. Finally, generating data packest and apply  Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, which finds the shortest paths between the source and the destination through a graph representing the  network routing problem.
