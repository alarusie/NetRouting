# NetRouting
A network simulation tool written in C language to demonstrate a network routing problem. It generates a set of number of randomly connected objects representing nodes, routers, and wires in a network, and simulates the transmission of network packets through the use of Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find the shortest paths.
