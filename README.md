# NetRouting
A network simulation tool written in C language to demonstrate a network routing problem. It generates a set of number of randomly connected computer network components, namely: nodes, routers, and wires. Then, it simulates packet transmission between nodes network packets by finding the shortest path between a sender and a receiver using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.
